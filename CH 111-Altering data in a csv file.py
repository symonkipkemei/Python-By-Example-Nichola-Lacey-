# ALTERING DATA IN A CSV FILE
# We already know how to read and write data in a csv file
# However we cannot be able to alter data in a csv
# therefore using the csv reader,
# we first convert the data into an iterable
# using the list constructor, generate a 2D list from our iterable
# we then have to append the data  to a temporary list
# whereby we can access individual data using indexing and alter them accordingly
