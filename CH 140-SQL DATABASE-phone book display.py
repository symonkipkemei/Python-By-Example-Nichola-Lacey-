""""
Using the PhoneBook database from program 139,
write a program that will display the following menu.
If the user selects 1, they should be able to view the
entire phonebook. If they select 2, it should allow them
to add a new person to the phonebook. If they select 3, it
should ask them for a surname and then display
only the records of people with the same surname. If
they select 4, it should ask for an ID and then delete that
record from the table. If they select 5, it should end the
program. Finally, it should display a suitable message if
they enter an incorrect selection from the menu.
They should return to the menu after each action, until
they select 5.
